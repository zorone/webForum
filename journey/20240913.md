—Rails 7 migrate from using `rails-ujs` to `turbo` by default. You have to migrate code from this shift.

[How To: Upgrade to Devise 4.9.0 [Hotwire Turbo integration]](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Upgrade-to-Devise-4.9.0-%5BHotwire-Turbo-integration%5D)

```text
rails generate devise:install
      create  config/initializers/devise.rb
      create  config/locales/devise.en.yml
===============================================================================

Depending on your application's configuration some manual setup may be required:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

     * Required for all applications. *

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root to: "home#index"

     * Not required for API-only Applications *

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

     * Not required for API-only Applications *

  4. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g devise:views

     * Not required *

`Rake db:migrate` -> `rails db:migrate`

- rake db:migrate is still usable.

See [this site (rails db:migrate vs rake db:migrate)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38403533/rails-dbmigrate-vs-rake-dbmigrate) for more detail
See [this site (How to Perform Rake Tasks in Rails)](https://dev.to/afaq_shahid/how-to-perform-rake-tasks-in-rails-ol2) for further reading

!!!. Needs to add these lines below, inside `/config/environment/development.rb` in `Rails.application.configure` scope. So that devise could work properly.

```ruby
  # For Devise
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: "localhost", port: 3000 }
```

`simple_form` gem break `bootstrap` button. You need to reconfigure them to make it works properly. Require server restart to apply those styles.

Trick: If you Sign Up and Stuck in Log In State. (Cannot Log Out) You can do the following:
    1. Open Developer Tools (Shortcut usually is `F12`)
    2. Go to `Application` Tab
    3. In `Storage` Section, expand `Cookies` tab, and select your development url. (It should be [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000))
    4. Select `_web_forum_session`, Right-click on them, then select `Delete`.
    5. Now you refresh your webpage (Don't require reloading your server. Just use `F5`.) It should resolve the issue.

Still need to investigate further for why it happens.

It's good ol' friend again. Same cause as method destroy we found beforehand.

- [No route matches [GET] "/users/sign_out" #4570](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4570)

`Forum.connection` -> `Forum.all`

`Forum.all` return array. So you can access using index.

Like this:

```ruby
Forum.all[2]    # This will return the 3rd element from the Forum. As ruby index is start at 0.
```

So, you can edit `user_id` like below. (I will show only for the `3rd` and `5th` forum.)

```ruby
> @forum = Forum.all[2]
> @forum.user_id = 4  # is it 4 or 1? Command execution and instruction is contradict with each other. From the context, it should be 1. Because this forum is about football. Therefore, user 1 which is football player are more suitable here.
> @forum.save
> @forum = Forum.all[4]
> @forum.user_id = 5
> @forum.save
```
