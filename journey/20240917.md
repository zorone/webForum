[CSS grid - How it works](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/css-grid/#how-it-works)
… I glossed over somethings. Grid system is still experimental. You need to enable it.

```css
$enable-grid-classes: false
$enable-cssgrid: true
```

Add the above codes at the top of .scss file.

`Open Sans Condensed` has been removed from google fonts, use this link instead:
[https://www.fontspace.com/open-sans-condensed-font-f22355](https://www.fontspace.com/open-sans-condensed-font-f22355)

The above assumptions is wrong. It IS still host on google font. Under `Open Sans` fonts.
See — [Open Sans - Designed by Steve Matteson](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans)
       — Select `Get font` -> `Get embed code` -> expand `Change styles` -> select `Condensed`

Have to change font family from `Open Sans Condensed` to `Open Sans`

Also need to restart server.
