Same problem (`turbo-rails`) in some part of comment implementation.

`col-md-4` -> `g-col-md-4`

- [Containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/)
- [Grid System - How it works](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#how-it-works)

`col` has to be inside `container` class.

I see… `col` have to be in `row`.

`row` don't require to be in `container`. But the result will be slightly different. Maybe it causes from padding?

`CSS grid` require you using from another dependencies. It didn't include in the main one.
